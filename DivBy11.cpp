/*
A number is divisible by 11 if the (sum of odd numbered digits) â€“ (sum of the even numbered
digits) is divisible by 11. Write a program that checks if a six digit number entered by the user is
divisible by 11 by finding the sums of its digits (even and odd ones) and then checking if the
difference is divisible by 11.
